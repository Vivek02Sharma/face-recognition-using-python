## Overview

This Python script demonstrates face recognition using the `face_recognition` library and `OpenCV`. It captures video from a webcam and identifies known faces based on pre-trained face encodings.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. So go to `cmd` or `command prompt` and run below requirements one by one:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

```bash
pip install dlib
```

```bash
pip install numpy
```

```bash
pip install face-recognition
```
and also you need `vs code`.


## How to use

**1.Create a folder on Desktop (by any name)**<br>
